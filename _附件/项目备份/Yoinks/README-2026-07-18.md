yoink any video. paste. yoink. done.

Download videos from YouTube, X/Twitter, Instagram, Threads, TikTok and
1,800+ other sites — right from your terminal. Paste a url, pick a
resolution (or audio-only mp3), done. No popups, no fake download buttons,
no sketchy redirects.

## Install

```sh
npm install -g yoinks
```

Or try it without installing anything:

```sh
npx yoinks
```

Requires Node 18+. Everything else (yt-dlp, ffmpeg) is fetched or bundled
automatically.

## Usage

```sh
$ yoinks https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ    # straight to the format picker
$ yoinks                                 # prompts for a url
$ yoinks --theme light                   # force the light palette
```

yoinks takes over the terminal (full-screen, centered — and restores your
scrollback on exit). Pick a format with ↑/↓ (or j/k, or number keys) and
hit enter. `esc` goes back, `^c` quits. Or just use the mouse — the yoink
button, the format list and the footer hints are all clickable, and
clicking the logo takes you back home. Files are saved to `~/Downloads`,
and the file path is printed to your terminal when you're done.

The default `auto` theme uses your terminal's own foreground and background,
so it follows light and dark terminal themes without guessing. Press `^t` or
click the theme control in the footer to cycle through `auto`, `light`, and
`dark` for the current session. Use `--theme auto`, `--theme light`, or
`--theme dark` to choose the starting theme for one launch.

## How it works

- Powered by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). On first run,
  yoinks downloads the standalone yt-dlp binary to `~/.yoinks/bin` —
  no Python required. If you already have yt-dlp installed, it uses yours.
- ffmpeg (needed for merging high-res streams and mp3 extraction) is found
  on your PATH, with `ffmpeg-static` as a bundled fallback.
- The UI is [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) — React for the
  terminal.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build        # bundle to dist/ with tsup
npm run dev          # rebuild on change
node dist/cli.js <url>
npm run typecheck
```

To try it as a global command without publishing: `npm link`, then run
`yoinks` anywhere.

## Roadmap

- [ ] `--best` / `--mp3` flags to skip the picker (scriptable mode)
- [ ] `-o <dir>` to choose the output folder
- [ ] Playlist / thread-with-multiple-videos support
- [ ] Clipboard detection: launch bare and auto-suggest the url you copied
- [ ] Self-update for the bundled yt-dlp binary (`yt-dlp -U`)
- [x] Publish to npm (`npm i -g yoinks` / `npx yoinks`)
- [ ] `curl yoinks.sh | sh` installer
